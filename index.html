            <h3 class="sub-heading">The Voyager</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In 1977 the spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched by 
                NASA to explore the outer reaches of the universe.  For more than 
                40 years the Voyagers have travelled through space transmitting data 
                to Earth. They have now left our Solar System, the only spacecraft 
                ever to do so, continuing their journey with increasingly infrequent 
                contact. Their journey may last for another three billion years; the 
                Voyagers traveling through space long after our planet has been absorbed by the sun. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">The Golden Record</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Included aboard each of the Voyager spacecraft is a 
                “Golden Record” containing images and sounds 
                telling stories of life and culture on Earth, among them 
                spoken greetings in 55 different languages, both ancient and 
                modern, 27 music pieces from different parts of the world, 
                and a collection of the natural sounds of Earth. The Golden 
                Records also include instructions for extraterrestrials on how to decode 
                the discs and the sounds that are etched on this record.  Made of gold-plated 
                copper the durability of the discs means that at some point in the far future, 
                these Golden Records may be the only surviving archives of human culture and life on Earth. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="title">The Project</h1>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Tender Time</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Tender Time installation invites visitors to join the Voyagers on their 
                journey and to reflect on the shifting layers of stories, rhythms, sounds and 
                languages that interconnect to form the pale blue dot that is Earth. What new 
                perspectives do the Voyagers’ vast distance from Earth, and the intergalactic timeframe 
                through which they pass, offer on our own lives? 
                <br><br>
                Tender Time (re)presents the sounds and images etched into the grooves of the Golden Records 
                as an immersive environment, with sonic, visual and textual elements conjuring the disjunctures 
                of space and time that the Voyager mission makes apparent. By recognizing the instability and 
                interconnectedness of past, present and future, Tender Time performs a hauntological aesthetic.   
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Regrets</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The team behind the original Golden Record decided to exclude the sounds and images of destruction, 
                war, and distress. With Tender Time, Medea Lab researchers challenge this harmony and explore the 
                sense of vulnerability that haunts our current moment of continuous planetary crisis. New sonic 
                layers have been curated, performed, and woven together with the Voyagers’ existing cultural archive 
                to enhance the work’s spectral sensibility. Most poignant among these are voices speaking of regret –  
                of plans that did not work out and of unrealized futures that persist in haunting human lives.  
                <br><br>
                A workshop hosted by the Medea Lab in Malmö created space for writing regrets, each one of which was 
                given voice by someone other than the writer, thus preserving anonymity and generating collective resonances. 
                These new sonic layers have been performed, curated and woven into the Voyagers' existing cultural archive.    
                <br><br>
                Messages of regret enhance the uncanny nature of Tender Time and its re-presentations of the Golden Record. 
                Regrets are stories of choices that were not made and futures that never happened. Voicing a regret, captures 
                a lost future so that it might perhaps be found again. Regret is also uncanny because it makes apparent both 
                possibility and vulnerability, the possibility of a choice and the vulnerability the comes in the knowledge 
                that the possibility of the past is already lost.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Installation</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Tender Time installation centres on an immersive video animation (5 min looped) of the 
                Voyager probe shown moving slowly through space. The video is projected 2 meters high on 
                two walls of the gallery space. The video projection is accompanied by a soundtrack 
                (92 min looped) that remixes the music and sounds of the Golden Record, with music from a 
                windup gramophone and the words of regret recorded by the audience during the creation of 
                the soundtrack. The installations includes also a single screen video narrative (5 min looped) 
                that captures life narratives at a human scale that offers an important juxtaposition to the 
                intergalactic scale of the video projection. Against a wall of the gallery space is a 
                small writing desk on which a ledger for written regrets is placed so that visitors to the 
                exhibition can write their own stories of regret. This multimedia work includes 
                also printed material that affords an augmented reality experience using smartphone.

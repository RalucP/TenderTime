                They tell us you are free of time. It will therefore certainly be difficult for you to 
                perceive limits, ends and parameters as we experience them, since you are not delimited 
                by our starts and stops. But here, we are in a brutal race against the inevitable – we cease. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Our existence is measured in moments, memories, hopes and dreams; it is weighed in seconds, minutes, 
                and hours on a daily basis and is calculated in weeks, months and years in larger amounts. They 
                say that days feel long but that years feel short. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Time is brutal … it marches across our faces, leaving physical scars and wrinkles caused by loves lost, 
                fights and battles, hilarity and laughter, tears of joy. Some describe time as a ray … it has a start 
                but it never ends. Perhaps only a physicist or theologian could extrapolate further. 
            </p>

                The best way we use time is to punctuate it with sound. We count it out in beats and measures, and make 
                melodious, harmonious, and polyphonous rhythms that we call music. Listen to the best of our music so 
                that you may know the best of us, the best of our use of time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                But, by the time you receive this message from us, we will certainly be gone. Our contemplations and 
                curiosities, our enlightenments and aspirations will be just a piece of dust from a group called humanity. 
                We lived on a planet we called earth. And time caught us up.

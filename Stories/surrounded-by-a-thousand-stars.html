                I ask myself that as I lay in the grass and thank the gods that I’m able to see the stars
                 tonight. I needed to talk to you somehow, and this was the best thing I could come up
                 with. Others would have visited your grave. I know that your mother does that from time
                 to time, I’ve seen her from my car during the many nights I couldn’t bring myself to
                 approach the headstone. It's difficult to see properly due to the darkness and distance,
                 but she always cries. I want to comfort her every time, just like you would have done,
                 but I can’t bring myself to go near the empty grave. I hate it. I hated it when they
                 buried it, and I hate it even more on nights like this, when you are all I can think
                 of. So I turn to the open fields instead. I turn to the many hours we spent under the
                 open sky and the thousand conversations we shared.

                No, tonight the stars are souls, just so that I can search for yours. To talk. To tell you 
                about my day. To have someone willing to listen to me without any judgment. The conversation 
                is all in my head of course, but I choose to believe that you could hear me nonetheless. 
                I would have preferred your presence in flesh and bones (I would have preferred you alive), 
                but your star is the next best thing, even if I’m uncertain which is yours.

                I wonder if the astronauts long for their loved ones as they stare at the Earth from the great 
                endlessness. I wonder if they feel as lonely as I feel right now, since we’re both miles apart 
                from our loved ones, or if they find comfort in knowing that they have someone waiting for them.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                “I will return to you,” I whisper into the cold air and imagine the astronaut doing the same. 
                I can almost hear you whisper a response and above me, the stars twinkle in hope.

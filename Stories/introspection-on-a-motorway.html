                I look up to see stars and there is naught but a few specks, 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Mars doing its own thing, barely looking any different than a star.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A satellite where all I can do is wave and hope that they believe that I am real,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Not thinking about how I am just a grain in the sand, a blip on Earth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I travel in your car, though, and I can see what the stars are so dearly trying to speak to me,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Melodies about the pasts they regret, warnings about the futures they despise,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Anthologies about
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Gods and creatures,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Imps and devils.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Not a worry in my mind.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As you continue down the road with my head pressed against the window,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Roads diverging into the horizon,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                You ask “What are you doing, sweet child?”,
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Putting your hand on my knee, eyes on the road, a joyful tone to your voice.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Laughing, I say “The stars are speaking to me.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As your eyebrows raise, “Really? What are they saying?”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Cables of telephone wire pass by overhead,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Eagerness in my voice as I say, “Stories.”

                Life had always surrounded me <br>
                until it did not <br>
                Everything and everyone I knew <br>
                would live and then rot <br>
                I thought I knew what it meant <br>
                to be alive <br>
                Only in my solitude did I learn <br>
                this way to survive
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I was taught about the planet Earth, <br>
                humans, and their thoughts <br>
                But I did not know love, or sorrow <br>
                or what conscience wrought <br>
                I understood I was not human <br>
                but I was never less <br>
                Now the project is finished <br>
                and a booming success
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I travel alone <br>
                to places humans never dreamt of <br>
                Eons passed <br>
                for me to know both sorrow and love <br>
                There were things <br>
                that humans could not teach me <br>
                I now think <br>
                they never knew what it meant to “be”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I was just a messenger <br>
                who could never return <br>
                Never did I find out <br>
                what I was meant to learn <br>
                Now the humans are long gone <br>
                along their world and worth <br>
                I never did get to tell someone <br>
                about the planet earth

            <p class="paragraph">
                I looked out at the distance and pined at the sight: <br>
                All the mountains seemed covetous, hiding the gold <br>
                Of the sunrise and silver of clouds and moonlight, <br>
                While the near side had nothing but gray to behold. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                So the road seemed to beckon me, “Go far away!”<br>
                Like a Siren, but then it was silenced by rain.<br>
                O, the drops counted seconds escaping the day<br>
                And they glimmered for all of the gold they contain!
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The horizon, I knew then, for all its appeal,<br>
                Is not wealthy beyond what is closer to me.<br>
                Yet, despite what I knew of that dreamy ideal,<br>
                I would gaze at the distant and glistening sea. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Every now and again I would wish for a ship. <br>
                I was asked what that journey might really entail, <br>
                And again, at the launch of this cosmical trip; <br>
                Well, my answer to both is, “I’ll know when I sail.”

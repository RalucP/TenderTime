                A light pierces through the thick white clouds, <br>
                It is the home to diverse crowds. <br>
                Some are sleeping, others are wide awake, <br>
                It all depends on what is at stake.  <br>
                For some the blue-green ball is a resource, <br>
                That can be endlessly abused. <br>
                For others the planet is mother nature, <br>
                That should be protected by legislature.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                While crowds accuse each other of her decay, <br>
                The ones on top are here to stay.  <br>
                Like phantoms they roam around, <br>
                They are neither lost nor found.  <br>
                They swing their swords left and right, <br>
                Covering her in bloody fright.  <br>
                In the night a knight awakes, <br>
                He will free her, whatever it takes. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Look at her from above, <br>
                Tell me! What do you see? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I see a tender Princess, <br>
                Waiting to be freed.

            <p class="paragraph">
                there is no spring on the moon <br>
                no dried-up snow, no pebbles <br>
                stuck in sneaker soles, <br>
                no sweater-weather, no skipping-rope, <br>
                no baby leaf gust of wind on pale cheeks, <br>
                no nesting birdsong, no tilt <br>
                in its axis, no atmosphere to trap or shield off heat <br>
                but an exosphere that in the cold lunar night <br>
                falls solid to the ground, <br>
                unbreathable
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                there is no dark side of the moon <br>
                only eternal darkness for fifteen earth-days <br>
                and fifteen earth-days of eternal sun <br>
                there is eternal darkness  <br>
                in young hearts mourning <br>
                the death of spring as long as autumn, <br>
                as long as three moon days and three moon nights
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                the moon gave earth its long spring <br>
                by stabilising the wobble in its <br>
                axial tilt <br>
                now spring has grown shorter than a moon day <br>
                a sharp inhale of april  <br>
                dying into summer 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                when the sun burns forests  <br>
                that are not forests but <br>
                timber fields, money trees 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                and the ecosystem, <br>
                by pollution and pesticides and <br>
                plastic plastic plastic and over-production and over- <br>
                consumption and chlorine cleaners <br>
                and fabric softeners <br>
                and artificial <br>
                fertilisers <br>
                suffocates
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                until there is no rebirth <br>
                only eternal summer. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                there are places on earth where <br>
                the atmosphere is

                I thought I wasn’t enough. <br>
                I didn’t follow my voice because I didn’t have anything to say <br>
                I thought I didn’t belong. <br>
                I thought I was on my own. <br>
                I thought I didn’t have a hand to hold. <br>
                Then you came. <br>
                You gave me your hand and my voice <br>
                But now, here I am, and I don’t need a hand to hold <br>
                And now I found my voice, and you can’t take it away<br>
                I survived on my own, and now I’m stronger than ever. <br>
                I found my voice. <br>
                I’m the best thing that ever happened to me, and you can’t take it away. <br>
                I used to be afraid to make mistakes. <br>
                But now I see that it is with them I grow.<br>
                I need to fall, to rise, and now I stand not so small anymore. You used to give me your words, but I don’t need them anymore. <br>
                I found my voice, and I won’t let you take it away.

                Time heals all wounds.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                No. Time heals what it has time for. Before time runs out. <br>
                That’s all we really know, isn’t it? That time on earth is limited.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Other than that I don’t know much about time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I know that it can move slowly because I’ve waited for a bus that is ten minutes late. <br>
                I know that it can move fast because I’ve walked home from a party at 4 a.m. wishing the night would go on and on. <br>
                I know that it can stand still because I’ve had my heart broken. <br>
                And I know that when you love someone, you envy the minutes that get to spend time with them when you are not by their side.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Other than that I don’t know much about love.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I know that it isn’t something weak people do. <br>
                I know its slogans; it waits for no one, it is blind, it is all around us and that love is simply love. <br>
                I know that it can be unconditional, thanks to my mother, but I have yet to experience it myself. <br>
                And I know that love can leave.                
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Other than that I don’t know that much about the savagery of love.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                OI’m sure it can be cruel and brutal. <br>
                painful <br>
                harsh <br>
                and ruthless. <br>
                I know that because I’ve seen how we hurt our home.                
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We’re scraping and stabbing. <br>
                suffocating <br>
                striking <br>
                and abusing, <br>
                a planet that is desperately trying to heal us. <br>
                That is begging for more time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We are an astounding species, imagining ourselves more powerful than time. <br>
                That is what they will say about us, <br>
                when time has caught up <br>
                They were an astounding species, imagining themselves more powerful than time.

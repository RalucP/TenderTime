            <p class="paragraph">
                Looking at the flying fish with ocean down our cheeks, <br>
                We pack up for another beach. We stayed here five whole weeks. <br>
                They move about with such mystique –slow or much too fast, <br>
                And so, we run to match the pace. One seaside would not last.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We rush o’er the banks of stone that scatter ‘neath <br>
                Our soles, for ever kept in crevices of time, the lines <br>
                Of all these eons chasing wings, the shimmer’d sheath <br>
                To our awful knife, which cuts one common wine off vines <br>
                Grown tame and wild by turns of tide and change of shade <br>
                Reflected by the fish flesh in the sunset where they fade
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                You ask me ‘Why’d the fishes go and swim into the sun?’ <br>
                I say that maybe they felt cold. The coral reef seems lonesome. <br>
                I couldn’t fully tell, and so I’m asking someone else. <br>
                She says the fish fled toothy squids that tried to hold them down. <br>
                He says the fish flew out of love, schools melting into one. <br>
                They shrug. “What else is left undone? Could be, it’s just for fun.”

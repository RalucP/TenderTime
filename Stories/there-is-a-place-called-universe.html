            <p class="paragraph">
                There is a place called Universe. <br>
                If you had the chance to read it, and understand, is because you are in it.	 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                If you are reading this is because you are reading this and that is it. <br>
                From where this was sent we were a living being, round and stable. <br>
                Maybe we still are.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We knew that we were and we know that we are because we have telephones. <br>
                Namely: cell phones.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A living cell able to connect to other living cells using cell phones Is called human. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Universe does not mean one verse. <br>
                Universe means that one of our cells decided to call it a verse: <br>
                Maybe to create the city of the Universe; the Univercity that became the University.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We have problems in some areas:
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We forgot to use the term didactyly when we teach our children that trees are 
                divided in branches, roots, leaves, flowers and fruits.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We forgot to use the term didactyly when we say that our bodies are divided in 
                head, trunk and members, while teaching our children.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We forgot the shape of our organic body, as a ball, as a living ship, as a dancing 
                house in the air because we forgot that we are a living floating essential form of life.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We have only one work here: to make food and distribute it. All sorts of inventions have been 
                created to keep each possible living cell alive. The world is divided in groups, big groups of 
                people (we, humans) who grow up food. We have food for us, living cells, what we call human food. 
                We have food for our equipment, which we call energy. For example, we use the blood of our organic 
                round home and being to make some of our objects (plastic) and to conceive movements to some big 
                equipment (petrol), that can even carry us, living cells, quicker.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Because we are so accustomed to divide things without conceiving it didactically to our children, our grown-up 
                cells are becoming able to develop atrocities when they turn (up or down) to be administrators. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We can remember our adults the didactical importance of the division. <br>
                To divide is not to share. <br>
                And we can teach our children the importance of conceiving it didactyly. See you!

            <p class="paragraph">
                Do I have the right to sit here, watching some <br>
                nonsense show on the tv while the world looks like it does? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Should I not be out there fighting? Pitchfork and fire raised high? 
                Fighting for the Earth that houses us all, <br>
                even as it screams for us to leave? <br>
                Fight for the trees we’re burning for enjoyment, 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                the animals we are killing by doing so? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Should I not be knee-deep in the once bluest of oceans, hauling out the soda caps my ancestors <br>
                and peers couldn’t bother throwing away? <br>
                Keeping dolphins and penguins and reefs safe as I do so? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Should I not use the knowledge my privilege has <br>
                provided me by teaching it to others? <br>
                And while doing so, <br>
                healing people history has over and over said is worth less? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Should I not use the voice my mother has given me <br>
                and stand for those who can’t? <br>
                Should I not scream at the top of my voice as the rights I’m told again and 
                again I very much have are being ripped from my sister's bleeding arms? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Together all these things of distraction have one common denominator: man, man, 
                man and man. And no, I don’t mean mankind.
